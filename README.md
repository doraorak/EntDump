# Info & Usage
This is an app that lists the entitlements of a mach-o executable. To use drag & drop the .app bundle or the executable into the window.

# Plans
Currently there is no gui message when there is no entitlements on a binary, the same goes for error messages. Maybe i can add them or accept a pr if someone does it.
